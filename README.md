### Tools Used


**The project scenario is stated below**:

## Scenario 1 -  Network filtering using Wireshark
_In this scenario, youâ€™re a security analyst investigating traffic to a website._

_Analyze a network packet capture file that contains traffic data related to a user connecting to an internet site. The ability to filter network traffic using packet sniffers to gather relevant information is an essential skill as a security analyst._

_You must filter the data in order to identify the source and destination IP addresses involved in this web browsing session, examine the protocols that are used when the user makes the connection to the website, and analyze some of the data packets to identify the type of information sent and received by the systems that connect to each other when the network data is captured._
